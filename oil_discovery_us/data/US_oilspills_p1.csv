The Western Upper Peninsula Health Department (WUPHD) confirmed the presence of mercury in the containers. One container was sealed, but the seal was broken on the second container, resulting in mercury being spilled onto the sandy lakebed as the container was carried to the dock.

On January 27th USCG unit Panama City, FL investigated the report of an orange-pink substance floating in St. Andrews Marina, near Panama City, FL.  The substance had no oily smell and in addition to floating, some of the material was present below the surface. It was also noted to be phosphorescent.  A sample was taken but not sent off to be analysed for oil.  On Sunday, January 30th, USCG received reports and photos of a similar material offshore of Panama City 6, 10 and 12 miles.  Based on the description, the NOAA SSC suspected an algal bloom, which has since been confirmed as Noctiluca scintillans, a non-photosynthetic, bioluminescent, and generally non-toxic algae that commonly blooms at this time of year, as well as other seasons.  This hotline report is being opened to capture the information for reference and in the event responders to the DWH Gulf Oil Spill receive inquiries on if the event is related to it.On February 18, additional reports of algal blooms have been coming into USCG and Florida Wildlife Commission (FWC) all across the FL Panhandle.

Fearful of capsizing, the captain put out a MAYDAY andall five crewmen were lifted from the vessel by a Coast Guardhelicopter.   Northeasterly winds caused the unmanned crabbing to driftparallel to the coast until the afternoon of Oct. 16 when it was in aposition 12 to 15 miles due north of Amak Island.  With winds shiftingto the north the Coast Guard became very concerned that it might groundon Amak Island, the site of a sea lion haulout, classified as anendangered species.   At this point the Coast Guard asked NOAA to getinvolved and provide a ""most likely"" trajectory for the vessel.   NOAA'strajectory had the F/V Raven just missing the east side of the islandand grounding on the barrier islands outside of Izembek Lagoon, aNational Wildlife Refuge being very sensitive with its large number oftransient waterfowl waiting to migrate southward.   The CGC Morgenthauwas on scene shadowing the Raven but was unable to attach a towline dueto the heavy seas.   Instead, it attached a drogue, which slowed themovement of the vessel.  Meanwhile the owner hired Dan Magone fromUnalaska to attempt to come to the scene and offer assistance.   Danarrived when the Raven was only 1 nautical mile off the NE coast of AmakIsland, and in a dramatic rescue was able to get a line on the vesselonly 0.3 nm from the island and keep it from grounding.    The Raven wastowed to the lee of the island where it was stabilized, outfitted with abetter tow bridle, and then was towed to King Cove to be repaired.

It was reported as scattered tarballs along a 10 -- 12 mile stretch of the NJ ocean beaches from Manisquan Inlet to Seaside Heights. The SSC recommended that overflights and SCAT patrols look on the inside of the coastal inlets, as oil might have migrated inside the bay areas on incoming flood tides. Cleanup recommendations and bird recovery and rehabilitation strategies were also discussed. The NOAA Damage Assessment Coordinator was also notified. The NMFS noted that a number of seals (Harbor, harp, hooded, and grey) may be in the area. So far there have been about 20 birds affected (both dead and for rehab). Species include cormorants, ganets, seagulls, and red-throated loons. Manual cleanup operations were underway. With the impending storm cleanup efforts were focused on removal of the gross oil (larger tarballs and patties). Assessments after the storm passes were made to determine the need for further cleanup. There has been no identified source of the oil. The USCG Districts 1 and 5 have passed the word to all units to be on the lookout for any suspect vessels. Samples of the tarballs have been sent to the USCG Oil Identification Lab in Groton, CT for fingerprinting. The SSC brought up the point that the source may also be one of the many sunken tankers off the coast. USCG aircraft expanded their search further offshore in an attempt to spot any subsurface sources. There had been fairly high local media interest both in the New York and Philadelphia areas as well as from local NJ community press. NOAA trajectory modelers investigated the possibility of performing a hindcast to determine where the source of the oil may have likely originated.

Since the event had just happen, the initial report was sketchy and limited to the location (29? 08.57' N Lat. 094? 40.20' W Long.), vessel name (Bonita), and preliminary situation (explosion - details unknown).  The NOAA SSC contacted the HAZMAT Duty Officer who arranged for ""Home Team"" scientific support.  Given the high probability of loss of diesel fuel and lube oils on board the vessel and the possibility of an uncontrolled well blow-out, the SSC requested that the event be addressed as a potential major release.	Weather forecast and trajectory implications were developed by the NOAA HAZMAT Home Team and verbally communicated to the USCG.  Given the forecast on an approaching winter frontal passage and the distance off-shore (25 plus miles), no landfall of oil was forecast for the next several days.  Any diesel fuel released would not persist more than a couple of miles from the release point due to the chemical nature of diesel oil and relative high seas (4-5').  The SSC also consulted with the Texas State SSC relative to trajectory implications.  	At approximately 2100 hrs, the USCG called to update the situation:  The lift boat did explode.  The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.  Six people were injured (broken bones and burns), but at this point, no fatalities.  The sub-sea safety valve was shut preventing any release from the well, and the well was reported to only be producing water at the time of the explosion.  This is still preliminary information, but the USCG was confident that there was no apparent well release based on confirming observations from a USCG vessel on-scene.  The lift boat was damaged, but the fuel tanks were reported to be intact.

The vessel contained 60 metric tons of #2 fuel oil, 532 metric tons of IFO 180, and 25 metric tons of gas oil.At 1427 hours July 21the M/V Navios Pioneer floated off the bank under her own power.  She was inspected at her anchorage and no damage to her bottom plating was noted.The NOAA trajectory analysis suggested that the winds were 10-15 knots from the WSW and would becoming more westerly as the afternoon progressed.  The forecast was for more westerly wind 5-10 knots through Thursday.  Based on these winds and that the ship was 7 miles offshore, NOAA did not anticipate the tidal currents to be strong enough to pull any spilled oil into Port Royal Sound.  NOAA also suggested that any oil spill over the initial 24 hours of the grounding would move offshore and to the east of east southeast.  If significant amounts of the IFO 180 that was on board the vessel would have been lost, NOAA suggested that it could persists for a week or two and result in tarball impacts to the beaches 10's of miles from the grounding site depending on the wind conditions at the time.

7382,1999-11-02,UTV Seaspan Commodore,Gulf of Alaska,58.003,-137.629,,bundles of logs,,"Due to heavy seas on February 11, 1999, the F/B Seaspan Rigger, being pulled by the UTV Seaspan Commodore, lost her deck cargo of logs into the northeastern Gulf of Alaska (GOA) about 38 nautical miles (nm) west of Cape Spencer.  On-scene conditions were 55-knot winds, 30-foot seas, snow, icing conditions, and 1/4 nm visibility.  The quantity of logs was quite large-200 to 400 log bundles of 80 to 100 logs per bundle.  The logs were 41 to 45 feet long and 4 to 15 inches in diameter; each bundle weighed approximate 27 tons.  The USCG deemed these logs a hazard to navigation of TAPS tankers, container vessels, and maritime traffic in the GOA.  Initially the logs were in MSO Juneau's zone and, along with the Seventeenth District Coast Guard Operations Center in Juneau, requested that NOAA provide weather forecasts and predict trajectories of the logs to monitor the position of the logs help their C-130 overflights.  NOAA's initial report to the USCG was that the trajectory of the logs will continue west-southwest at 2% of the wind speed (0.5 knots) until they cross the 100-fathom curve where they will encounter the Alaska Current and begin moving in a west-northwest direction at approximately the same speed.Due to the severe weather, many of the log bundles broke apart making it very difficult for ships' radar to see this debris.  The weather was not cooperative and overflights could be conducted only every 3 to 5 days.  As location reports came in, they were forwarded to NOAA in Seattle who then used this information to provide a search location for the next overflight.  The Alaska Stream occupies this portion of the GOA and moves from east to west and the logs were gradually dispersed and carried west-northwest toward the central GOA.  As the logs moved west, MSO Valdez became involved in the tracking effort and served to coordinate information flowing to and from USCG Kodiak Air Station who was conducting the overflights.

The spilled oil was a condensate crude with an API of 38.  The stretch of shoreline from Galveston to Freeport is historically an area with high concentrations of birds.  In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.  However, because of the high concentrations of birds present in the area of the predicted impact, there was a risk of birds getting oiled.  USCG district 8.

Heavy surf and high winds throughout the next several days made boarding the vessel difficult and dangerous. While the preferred option was to salvage the vessel with the oil on board, the Unified Command requested that contingency plans for vessel lightering, cleanup and pollution response be developed. The longer the ship remained grounded, the greater the risk of it leaking its load of nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel oil. Moreover, a small group of endangered snowy plover was located approximately 800 yards south of the vessel.  In fact, on February 8, shipboard personnel observed oil burping out alongside the ship from a small crack in the hull and on the beach near the ship.  On February 9, a tug tried to pull the ship off the beach. But by then winds and waves had driven the New Carissa approximately 600 feet further shoreward, beyond the operational reach of the salvage vessel and its ability to safely anchor near the surf zone. The bow section was towed and sunk on March 11, 1999 in 1,811 fathoms of water 282 nautical miles off the Oregon coast.  58 Federal, state, county, and local agencies took part in the month-long response.

PHONE (206) 526-6317. - _ - Per your request we have looked at trajectory implications of the urea that has been released from the barge Alaska.  These notes are based on the following information:-  - A barge located at 56? 28'N, 132? 23'W (Wrangell, Alaska) is reported to have cracks in the starboard and portside.  The vessel is carrying an unknown amount of urea stored as a bulk product.  At this time, the vessel is not leaking product.-  - If any of this initial information is incorrect, please let us know ASAP as it would affect any trajectory implications. - _ - 1) WEATHER - Today, the winds are forecast from the south at 30 knots with rain.  Tomorrow, the rain is expected to continue with winds from the south at 25 knots. -  - 2) GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF UREA - Urea is a white crystal or powder with very faint odor. It has a density of 1.3 (it would sink in water) and is soluble in water. Urea is commonly present in nature, in urine and other body fluid. As a fertilizer, urea contains 45-46% nitrogen, and is usually in the form of small pellets or granules. It is shipped in bags or in bulk.  -  - 3) TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS - The harbor is generally shallow and is rapidly flushed due to tidal action.  Any dissolved product will be quickly diluted by water exchange through the harbor entrance.  The dissolved urea will not affect the pH of the water much, the effect, if there is any, will be localized, and given the tidal current present any effect will quickly dissipated because of the flushing effect in the harbor. -  - 4)FATE AND EFFECT OF UREA - Solubility - Urea is very soluble in water.  In the case of a capsized vessel, the urea pellets will sink to the ocean floor while  dissolving in the water column. Water currents facilitate the dissolution process of urea in the same way that stirring a cup of coffee helps dissolve the sugar faster. Since the urea was stored in bulk, the granules may disperse as a ""cloud"" of fertilizer, each granule sinking independently while coming in full contact with the water. - Effect on pH - When urea dissolves in water it forms a weak base. The pH of the ocean water varies between 6.5 to 8.5. Usually it tends to be somewhat basic. In addition, the ocean has a substantial buffering capacity. In the past even large urea spills had minimal effect on the pH and we would expect the similar process during this incident. - Effect on the environment - We would not expect to see any algae bloom or other nutrient driven changes. The spilled urea dissolves quickly, eventually turning into carbon dioxide which escapes as gas and dissipates, and ammonia, which dilutes in the prevailing tidal current and quickly drops to ambient concentration. It is quite possible that the concentration of available nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) may be elevated for a short period of time at the immediate location of the spill. However, considering the rapid dilution and dispersion into the water column, exposure to organisms is predicted to be short-term. The biological literature focuses on phytoplankton effects and these seem to be mediated by light.  At this time of the year, the phytoplankton population is relatively small, and the amount of daylight minimal.  Adverse effects are expected to be minimal and confined to the harbor.

An MSO team was dispatched and found trace amounts of dime sized tarballs along the beach.  Personnel from the Point Reyes National Seashore and the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary began collecting oiled live birds and dead birds.  The Coast Guard conducted an overflight, but did not find any floating oil.  By Monday, there were over 50 birds found dead, and an estimated 200 birds observed oiled in an area extending out to the Farallone Islands and south to Ocean Beach.  Among the birds affected were 7 Snowy Plovers and one Brown Pelican, both endangered species.  The International Bird Rescue and Research Center in Berkeley CA began cleaning and rehabilitating oiled birds.  Assessment teams continued to find dime to half dollar sized tarballs along the shoreline and in the high tide debris line from Drakes Beach to Limantour Beach.  On Tuesday the SSC conducted an overflight and found no floating oil.  Clean up teams began removing oiled debris. In addition to oiled birds, there was a report of nine oiled (estimated 2% coverage) Elephant Seals observed near Chimney Rock. Shoreline assessment, wildlife collection, cleaning and rehabilitation continued.  On Wednesday, the assessment teams found no new oiling.  The cleanup crews finished cleaning the impacted areas.  Wildlife teams had collected a total of 78 oiled birds for cleaning, and found 194 birds dead.  Teams continued assessment of beaches and wildlife collection and observations.  Thursday continued with shore assessments, wildlife collections and observations.  There was no further shore impacts and sign off of some areas was started.  However late in the day, an additional 50 freshly oiled birds were reported and there were concerns about additional floating oil.  Today, the SSC conducted another overflight concentrating in an area between the Farallone Islands, Point Reyes and Bolinas Point.  Some areas of oil were found.  The areas consisted primarily of trace amounts of silver sheens and some scattered tarballs with sheen in convergence lines.  A larger area of sheen, tarballs, and tar patties was found south of the area about 20 east of San Pedro Point.

It is possible that the release was gradual over the course of weeks or months until the material released reached a level that caused a visible reaction in the waters of the barge canal.  The spill site is actually two water bodies; an industrial barge canal in Bienville Industrial Park and a freshwater riverine/marsh habitat in the adjacent Mulatto Bayou.  Mulatto Bayou runs somewhat parallel to the barge canal with several bank cuts allowing water interchange between the two.Hopper barges RL-224 and RL-229 had been alongside the industrial park at the dead end of the barge canal for several weeks and several months, respectively.  Their cargo of dry ferrous sulfate was destined for Eaglebrook Inc. but was rejected because it was out of specification for their needs.  Ferrous sulfate is reacted in a controlled situation by Eaglebrook to make a flocculating agent used in wastewater treatment.  As the barges waited at the industrial park pending final disposition, it is believed that water entered the barges through holes in their wing tanks and then, through free communication with the hoppers themselves, made contact with the cargo.

The USCG MSO dispatched a USCG Fire Fighting Coordinator, HAZMAT team, and a 41-foot patrol boat to assist the Seattle Fire Department Incident Commander.The fire started in the forward part of the processing area of the vessel when a welding spark fell on combustible material.  The fire spread to the lower deck and forward to the forecastle, causing extensive damage to the factory processing area.  Smoke from the fire necessitated closing the Ballard Bridge to traffic.  The main fire was extinguished at 1130, but the vessel contained hot spots and continued to have small flare ups through the night and into the next day.  Chlorine levels continued to be detected on the vessel and on the dock alongside, but, due to the threat of re-flash, the Seattle Fire Department suspended efforts to mitigate the potential chlorine release until November 10.  A USCG HAZMAT team member remained on-scene with the Seattle Fire Department overnight fire watch.  A unified command was set up among the USCG, State of Washington, vessel owner, and the Seattle Fire Department to address the continuing threat of a chlorine and/or ammonia release from the vessel.  The unified command met several times November 9 and 10 to review plans for site safety, the proposed repair and removal of the chlorine cylinders, ventilation of lower compartments, and vessel salvage.  The chlorine threat was mitigated, the fire completely extinguished, and the vessel declared safe for entry by the morning of November 10.

The San Jacinto River rose from its normal height of 2.5 feet to 24.3 feet.  The river overtopped its banks, cutoff a meandering loop, and scoured a new channel through a normally dry area containing pipelines.  As a result of the flooding, Houston had been declared a National Disaster Area and the estuarine environments of Galveston Bay were stressed because of the influx of fresh floodwaters.   As the flood waters began to recede, pipelines began to rupture.It was surmised that large debris or some barges had broken free and were caught in the high-river currents and collided with the pipelines, causing four of them to rupture.  It is also possible that the new channel cut by the flooded river may have undercut the pipeline supports, which were not designed for water crossing.   The ruptured pipelines contained gasoline, crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas.  Within hours of the ruptures, the spilled products ignited and, already caught up in the flood waters, become a burning mass moving downstream.  The fires destroyed many homes along the river banks.  However, as a result of the fire much of the spilled products were consumed.  After some time, the fire continued only at the source of the leaks.

Inital reports state that a vegetated area south of Waterfront Road, and north of a railroad line has been impacted by gasoline.  Another vegetated area south of the railroad line has apparently been impacted by a Diesel Quality Reformate (Cutter Stock).

5034,1994-07-01,BARGE MORRIS J. BERMAN,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",18.4717,-66.09,,# 6 fuel oil,,"On January 7, 1994, the barge Morris J. Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The barge grounded on a hard bottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral after its towing cable parted.The barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The cargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow intertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong northerly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong creating a hazardous situation as they pounded the deck of the vessel. The responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly expended the ten million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full federal funding of the spill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a United States Coast Guard (USCG) directed response.The USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought onscene and immediately began lightering operations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an estimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and assessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made however due to continued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not yet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas at risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most heavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons near the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats, accumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  Submerged oil posed a major cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers, vacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were collected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the effluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea. On January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San Juan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), Navy Superintendent of Salvage (SUPSALV), the GST, and NOAA.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given an opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  It was agreed by all that the sinking of the barge was the best alternative.  Continued re-oiling of the nearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and preventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was hoped that the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little impact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were predicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.Shoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.  Surface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.  Beachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners as approved.  Some inaccessible areas were left to clean naturally.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures were developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These structures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.On February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence zone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released from the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to Borinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in the protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the west end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews removed the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were intensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent. All necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.  With the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge's grounding site, there were very few impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near the grounding site.  Very few birds were affected and no substantiated reports of spill related mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was divided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and inspected following the ""how clean is clean"" guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by April 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which was completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and maintenance phase to address any additional oiling that may occur.  USCG district 7.

The MSO hired cleanup contractors for this federally funded cleanup; the facility owner refused to take responsibility.   Contractors placed boom in the water and began steam cleaning bulkheads, riprap, and pilings.  Oil-soaked soil leaking through a bulkhead proved to be the source of the slick.Found on the site were twenty-three tanks containing unknown product and sludge, three unmarked drums, bags of asbestos waste, hundreds of bales of shredded paper and other garbage, and two five-inch artillery shells.  Two tanks were unstable and many were without tops or had holes cut in them. The USCG contacted the Philadelphia Bomb Squad to remove the artillery shells and was contacted by the Philadelphia Environmental Crimes Unit concerning other possible legal infractions at the site.

The fire initially was burning oil and gas, but the oil fire went out after a short time. Although the fire appears not to be damaging the rig, one person was injured due to burns.  Debra Simecek-Beaty, NOAA, overflew over the spill area (H-65) from 1220 to 1320.  On scene winds were about 15 knots from the NE.  The rig was on fire and a slick extended from the rig to the western end of East Timbalier Island.  The slick contained mostly silver and rainbow sheen with a narrow band of dark colored streamers.  Burn residue was also observed in the slick.  Shoreline impacts on East Timbalier Island extended from the western tip and along the northern shore to the radio tower.  No impacts were observed east of the radio tower.  Two subsequent overflights mapped the shoreline features in greater detail since there had been more than a dozen breaks in the island due to Huricane Andrew.  Winds had increased to greater than 20 knots and a significant sea swell was forming, resulting in 5 -7 foot breakers on the Gulf side of the island.  Although visibility had diminished due to the lower sun angle, it appeared that the amount of oiling in the marshes had decreased significantly.  Only one small pocket of black pooled oil was observed in contrast to yesterday. The oil did not appear from the overflight to have undergone any significant emulsification.  A flight restricted zone with a radius of 5 miles and an altitude of 3000 feet was established around the rig at 1511 for all non- response aircraft.  The zone restriction will last for 6 hours.  The 36 inch boom that was deployed around the rig was destroyed in the fire.  The Coast Guard has deployed two more booms to the west of the rig.

NOAA recommended that the spartina not be cut.The SSC told the FOSC that the pollutants should not spread rapidly because of the location of the barges, the shape of the cut, and the fact that the wind is the primary influence over the localized currents.   NOAA recommended using a bubble curtain if a water-soluble product was released into the water column.  NOAA suggested containing all the product within the far end of the canal in which the barges were located. In addition, four paddle-wheel aerators should be placed diagonally across from each other to generate a circular current within the containment area.  NOAA also recommended damming the cut where the barges were located.  If polychlorinated biphenyls or Aroclor were onboard the barges, as suspected, removing sediments could be necessary in the event of a major release.There probably was a spill of around 300 gallons from the Z-62 barge.   According to chemistry analyses from the site, there were at least three different types of oils in the sediment.  The water column was clean.  Samples of the barge's product are being analyzed.  It will not be possible to determine the extent of the spill on the area until the analyses of these samples are completed and compared to the sediment samples.The disposal of these barges is an ongoing effort and has been halted due to a lack of funds.

WB&C personnel also applied foam inside the vessel's cargo tanks to prevent re-ignition of the vessel.River flow data were obtained from the Army Corps of Engineers to predict the oil movement.  Shock waves from the explosion may have contributed to the deaths of several fish that were recovered from around the vessel.

Two holes were punctured in one of the vessel's cargo tanks, releasing 9458 barrels of heavy crude oil into the water approximately 1.3 miles from Huntington Beach, California.The master of the vessel immediately reported the incident to the USCG Marine Safety Office/Group Los Angeles-Long Beach (MSO/Group LA-LB).  The master moved the American Trader into deeper water one mile to the south.  The commanding officer of the MSO/Group assumed the role of the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC).  The responsible parties assumed full financial responsibility for the spill and sent representatives to the Long Beach area.Oil began to come ashore on February 8 in light concentrations around Newport Pier.  By February 9, oil was ashore at Huntington Beach; in some instances, oil in the surf zone here appeared to be in heavier concentrations than observed earlier at Newport Beach. Calm seas and fair weather for most of the response period resulted in a rapid and successful cleanup.  All of the beaches were cleaned by March 2.  The FOSC concluded all cleanup operations by April 3.The 22,000 barrels of crude remaining in the damaged cargo tank were lightered by personnel from the USCG Pacific Strike Team and the responsible party using the USCG Air-Deliverable Anti-Pollution Transfer System (ADAPTS).  By 1200 on February 9, the oil from the damaged tank plus 90,000 barrels from the mid-body tanks had been transferred into barges to decrease the draft of the vessel.  Temporary patches were applied to the holes in the hull and the American Trader was moved to an oil transfer facility in Long Beach Harbor to off-load the remaining 470,000 barrels of crude oil.

NOAA hypothesized that some vapor from the solid dimethoate may have leaked into the closed container during shipment, and that it was this vapor that was detected while the vessel was en route to San Francisco.  The concentration in the atmosphere within the container was probably never at a toxic level even though it would have been uncomfortable to breathe.  Once the container was opened and exposed to circulating air, the detectable odor would dissipate rapidly.    NOAA recommended that personnel involved in the inspection of the shipping container be suited in Level B protection as a conservative measure as dimethoate does not present a significant inhalation hazard when shipped in solid form.  The primary concern with this product was to avoid inhalation or ingestion of airborne dust from a potentially damaged shipping container and to restrict dermal contact to minimize any chance of skin absorption.  A visual inspection of the container by the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office found no evidence of damage to the container or spillage of dimethoate.  Accordingly, the container was left aboard the vessel for continuation to the WAARDRECHT's destination in Mexico.   The case was closed after the container was inspected and found to be undamaged.

The materials that were reported by Mr. Winkler varied, but he stated that they were affecting his health and the health of his neighbors.  NOAA advised that potential health and/or environmental impacts should be reported to local and state health officials and to state environmental officials.  Mr. Winkler reported that he had made a number of these reports to State and County officials but was not satisfied with their response.  After the first call, NOAA looked at the thermal images of the Gulf Stream and discussed with Mr. Winkler that Gulf Steam waters or material dumped in New York City would not be in direct contact with Bethany Bay beaches.  NOAA also contacted marine laboratories and phytoplankton experts at the University of Delaware, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Laboratories at Mountlake, WA, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.  The names and contact numbers for phytoplankton experts at these institutions were provided to Mr. Winkler.   NOAA coordinated with the State of Delaware's environmental officials on each of the ""red tide"" reports that we received and with our efforts in contacting expert laboratories to determine the results of Mr. Winkler's samples.  On September 15th the Delaware's Director of Water Resources wrote a 4-page letter to Mr. Winkler listing the considerable efforts of the State of Delaware's Department of Water Resources to investigate each of Mr. Winkler's reports.  Delaware's letter noted that samples analyzed by DNREC ""reveal no Pfieseria, no significant water chemistry findings, and no presence of organisms in bloom-like conditions"" and that the ""water samples collected by you (Mr. Winkler) and DNREC that have been analyzed by the Florida Marine Research Institute and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute have revealed no harmful species, no toxic dinoflagellate species, and no red tide cell concentrations."" On September 22ed the NOAA SSC discussed Mr. Winkler's reports with the Chief of the Bethany Beach Fire Company and a member of the Bethany Beach Town Council.  Both the Fire Chief and the member of the Town Council reported that there were no unusual health impact reports from swimmers using the city's beaches.    On September 29th the laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington reported to DNREC that they were able to detect numbers of plankton specie named ""Chattonella verruculosa"" in the samples of water that were provided to them by Mr. Winkler.   This plankton had previously been reported in waters as far north as North Carolina, but experts at the University of North Carolina reported that it was unusual for this species to be as far north as Delaware.  This plankton did produce a brevetoxin  On October 12th the State of Delaware organized a seminar to discuss the complexity of the algal booms and their potential toxicity in Mid Atlantic Ocean waters.  As a result of Delaware's efforts, scientists from Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina are sharing information on the algal booms reported off their coasts.  It seems clear to these scientists that much of the ""reds stuff in the water"" sightings reported during the summer of 2000 were algal booms.  The scientists reported that it is not unusual for these blooms to drift with the currents and appear or disappear from one day to the next (or even hour to hour.)  The ""disappearing"" of the bloom is likely due to wind and other weather conditions.  For example, when it is windy, the bloom, that is often concentrated near the surface, can be mixed down several feet and thus become almost invisible.  If the wind subsides and the sun conditions are right, these organisms can float or swim back to the surface and again become much more visible.

The Coast Guard learned of the spill from media reports on May 4 and confirmed the information with the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation.It was later learned that approximately 336 tons of PFS fertilizing solution (75% phosphoric acid) had entered the river over the weekend.  This was out of a total of 3,937 tons spilled during transfer procedures on April 30.  The acid sank to the bottom of the turning basin at the mouth of the river, then migrated upriver and out  along the bottom of the dredged channel into Hillsborough Bay with the tides.

Apparently, a blowout preventer (BOP) valve malfunction caused the initial blowout.  Although the BOP had successfully shut the annulus between the drill pipe and well casing, the blind rams failed to shear through the drill pipe that was still in the well casing.  Therefore, oil and gas flowed out of the well, up the drill pipe, and onto the platform where it ignited.  The oil discharge increased after the escaping gas and oil forced the drill pipe out of the well.  The initial fire was extinguished by October 17.  As of October 28, the well was still spewing out a yellow gas/crude mix  60-100 feet in the air.  The owners of the well, Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), and the Mexican Navy participated in cleanup operations.  The well was finally ""killed"" on November 30.  Even though the incident site was 600 miles from Texas, the slick could have traveled in a northerly direction to reach United States waters depending on the duration of the spill.  Accordingly, the USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) at Corpus Christi, Texas, was notified of the incident on October 13.  Verification and correct information were not received until October 16.  Even though USCG assistance was refused, the USCG conducted overflights of the area every other day until the well was capped to track the spill response and the movement of the oil.

Funds for the spill cleanup initially came from the USCG revolving oil pollution fund.  An overflight of the area was conducted at 1400.   The spill occurred during a time when thousands of migratory birds are overwintering in the area.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 of these birds were oiled as a result of the spill.  Many birds were treated at the South Whidbey Island Wildlife Clinic.  On December 23, personnel at a bird clinic established at Mukilteo's Olympic Junior High school began cleaning and feeding hundreds of oiled birds.  The birds were washed with dish washing detergent and tube-fed a mixture of Kaopectate, honey, high-protein baby cereal, activated charcoal, thirst-quencher, and poison antidote until the center received a high-protein feed donated by Ralston Purina's Woodinville, Washington plant.  Due to this donation and excellent handling, 60 percent of the 428 cleaned birds were last reported as surviving, as compared to an average survival rate of 20 percent for oiled birds.Manual cleanup of beaches was most prevalent where waters were too shallow for cleanup vessels.

The vessel was loaded with 91,984 barrels of lube oil and lube oil additives and 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel. Two crewmen and the pilot from the vessel were thrown into the water by the blast. The pilot and one crewman were recovered with serious burns.  One crewman remained missing and was presumed dead after an extensive search.  The explosion caused a relatively minor release of oil.  Flames from the initial and subsequent explosions shot as high as 1000 feet into the sky.  The fires on board the vessel were extinguished by late afternoon on November 1.Following the explosion, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) ordered the vessel towed out of the vicinity of San Francisco Bay.  The intent of the order was to minimize the potential for catastrophic environmental effect from a massive release of oil.  On the basis of trajectory forecasts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommended that the vessel be towed to the vicinity of a nearby ocean dumping site (37 32 N, 122 59 W).  This position is at the continental shelf break, 10 miles SE of the Farallon Islands.  The ongoing firefighting and cooling efforts were hampered as the vessel moved farther from shore. The weather worsened on November 2, with seas as high as 16 feet and wind speeds up to 35 knots.  Salvage and inspection activities ceased for the day.  On November 3 at 0000, the Puerto Rican broke in two, releasing 25,000-35,000 barrels of its cargo and an undetermined amount of the 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel onboard.  The stern section sank one mile inside the boundary of the Point Reyes/Farallon Islands National Marine Sanctuary, taking most of the 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel with it.Keystone Shipping Co. of Philadelphia immediately assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.

Weather at the time was cloudy and overcast with light rain.  Visibility was 8 miles with winds gusting from the northwest to 25 miles per hour.  Crew error was the primary cause of the accident.  The barges, V882, V883, V884, and V885, were laden with a total of approximately 65,003 barrels of Montana Mix sour crude oil.  One of the barges exploded on impact and burst into flames.  As the fire continued to spread, the tow broke, setting three of the burning barges adrift down the river.  The tug and attached barge V885 were moved to the Peabody Coal facility at mile 179.2 for lightering and inspection.The three drifting barges caused extensive damage to facilities and other barges along the left descending bank on the Illinois side of the river.  While traveling downriver, one of the barges struck the Pillsbury Grain dock facility.  The fire spread to the dock, the grain elevator, and trees and bushes on the shoreline.  Three grain barges nearby caught fire as well.  A coal barge on the Missouri side of the river ignited from contact with one of the barges.  The Monsanto dock caught fire after being struck by one of the barges, and the impact ruptured a pipeline on a walkway, releasing approximately 100 pounds of monochlorobenzene into the river.Barge V884 suffered the most damage, both the barge and its discharged cargo on the river's surface were in flames.  After drifting downstream, V884 sank at mile 178.2 Upper Mississippi River (UMR) near the Cahokia Power Plant.  The barge continued to release its total cargo of 10,882 barrels of crude oil.  While burning out of control, barge V883 lodged bow first into the bank above the Cahokia Power Plant.  The fire spread uncontrollably onto the shore.  An hour later, V883 broke loose and continued drifting down the river, still engulfed in flames.  The M/V Katie  eventually grounded V883 by pushing it into the bank at the Pillsbury Facility.  The leading barge, V882, was forced into the Arsenal Island barge fleet area after being controlled by the M/V Gary D. Partridge.  The USCG Cutters Obion  and Cheyenne  fought the fire on V883 as well as the fire at the Phillips facility.  The cutters used all but two of their fire fighting foam cans.  To reduce the probability of reflash, the Cheyenne  applied a low-velocity water fog to V883.  The M/V Tom McConnel  used her propwash to keep burning oil on the water from reaching the Cheyenne  during firefighting operations.  By 1330 on April 3, the fires on the three escaped barges, the three grain barges, and the Pillsbury dock were out.  Valley Towing Service, Inc., the owners of the tug and barges, assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.  Three pollution cleanup sites were established at mile 177.6, 176.6, and 176.2 UMR.  A joint Regional Response Team (RRT) Region V and VII meeting was held in St. Louis on April 5, 1983.

The vessel initially spilled about 950 barrels of light oil and continued to leak for the duration of the incident.  An initial survey found nine of 12 tanks holed.  The ship's refrigeration system failed, releasing toxic levels of ammonia gas in the interior.   Access to the vessel was complicated by the rough seas and a 200-foot high cliff at the grounding site.  A makeshift, 90-foot highline was rigged from the base of the cliff to the ship.  The only alternative mode of access was by helicopter, which was not always available because of weather.The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Office (MSO), Anchorage, the predesignated On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) for the spill, sent a representative to the site on November 9.  The owners of the vessel initially assumed responsibility for cleanup operations, but abandoned their responsibility on November 15, at which time the OSC took full control of the spill response.

The cargo of catalytic cracker feedstock and Santa Maria crude oil spilled into the sea as the fire burned for ten hours.   Lightning apparently ignited accumulated cargo vapors on the deck of the vessel.  None of the cargo tanks had been gas-freed.  The explosion was so powerful that a 5 foot by 7 foot hull fragment from the burning vessel penetrated the roof of a Shell Oil Company petroleum product shore tank located 600 feet inland from the vessel.  The contents of that shore tank, approximately 26,000 barrels of ethyl alcohol, ignited and burned as well.  As the fire spread into a nearby barge slip, four barges that were discharging cargo caught fire.  Three of these barges exploded and sank.  No significant amount of pollution came from any of these four barges.  Weather during the incident was warm and windy with heavy downpours and lightning.  The maximum reported wind gust for the day was 33 knots, at 1300.The fireboat M/V Captain F. L. Farnsworth, which had been moored 2.5 nautical miles from the terminal, was on-scene by 1430.  Four boats and 14 Coast Guard personnel assisted in fire fighting and lifesaving operations.  Two Coast Guard pollution team investigators from the Houston Port Safety Station were already on their way to the Shell terminal when the accident occurred.  They led the rescue of the burning vessel's boatswain from the forecastle.  Representatives from both the USCG Pacific and Gulf Strike Teams (PST and AST) monitored all phases of the cleanup.  Eighteen different cleanup companies were involved in the cleanup operations.  Since the spill occurred over a holiday weekend, it was difficult to recruit companies with equipment specifically needed for this spill.  One crew member and two radar repairmen aboard the SS Chevron Hawaii  were killed and 13 people were injured.  Even though six tugs were available within the barge slip, no attempt was made by the Shell Oil Company dockman or the tugboat operators to move any adjacent barges into the channel where they might have been safe from the fire.  Also, the dockman left the scene without activating the emergency cut-off switch.  This would have assured that any adjacent barges' cargo openings were properly secured.

The water depth at the wellhead site is about 50 m (164 feet). The IXTOC I was being drilled by the SEDCO 135, a semi-submersible platform on lease to Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). A loss of drilling mud circulation caused the blowout to occur. The oil and gas blowing out of the well ignited, causing the platform to catch fire. The burning platform collapsed into the wellhead area hindering any immediate attempts to control the blowout. PEMEX hired blowout control experts and other spill control experts including Red Adair, Martech International of Houston, and the Mexican diving company, Daivaz. The Martech response included 50 personnel on site, the remotely operated vehicle TREC, and the submersible Pioneer I. The TREC attempted to find a safe approach to the Blowout Preventer (BOP). The approach was complicated by poor visibility and debris on the seafloor including derrick wreckage and 3000 meters of drilling pipe. Divers were eventually able to reach and activate the BOP, but the pressure of the oil and gas caused the valves to begin rupturing. The BOP was reopened to prevent destroying it. Two relief wells were drilled to relieve pressure from the well to allow response personnel to cap it. Norwegian experts were contracted to bring in skimming equipment and containment booms, and to begin cleanup of the spilled oil.

The damage was attributed to a fracture initiated by a weld defect and aggravated by wave impacts on the bow at low temperatures.  Although the tanker remained intact for some time after the initial hull plate failure, the bow and stern sections eventually separated and spilled an estimated 43,900 barrels of Bunker C into Cabot Strait.  The bow and stern sections drifted towards Canadian waters.  Approximately 50,000 barrels of oil remained in the bow section while 115,000 barrels remained in the stern.A wide band of mobile pack ice initially prevented the spilled oil from reaching the shoreline.  The Environmental Protection Service (EPS) immediately initiated the formation of the Regional Environmental Emergencies Team (REET) to provide assistance and advice to the Canadian Coast Guard's (CCG) On-Scene Commander (OSC).  REET members included the Atmospheric Environment Service, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, and Fisheries Management Service.  The REET was divided into three sections to deal with the three distinct problems: the bow, the stern, and the oil spill cleanup.  Under Lloyds Open Forum, the stern section was towed to Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, to recover remaining oil.  The bow section was towed to a deep water area 200 nautical miles off Nova Scotia and sunk by gunfire from the HMCS Margaree  on April 1, 1979.

The three remaining crew members were not found.The Regional Response Team (RRT) and Science Advisory Group (SAG) agreed that the best option in dealing with the damaged vessel was to attempt to tow the two sections away from the Hawaiian islands, and sink them.  The U.S. Coast Guard cutters Mallow and Jarvis were diverted to the scene for towing operations.  The sections were approximately 70 miles apart when the two cutters arrived at the stern section.  Since crew members were unable to board or tow the stern section due to rough seas, the Mallow continued on toward the bow section.  The stern section of the tanker presumably sank at approximately 26 55 N and 172 30 W.  By January 21, the bow section had only 25 feet of freeboard.

The two vessels remained joined together while several damaged cargo tanks on the Oregon Standard began releasing bunker C fuel oil into San Francisco Bay.  Contributing factors to the incident were dense fog and darkness.Spill response started almost immediately.  A command post was established by 0445 by representatives from USCG District 12, the California Department of Fish and Game (CA DFG), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Although water borne movement of cleanup and containment equipment was hampered by the dense fog, containment booms were in place around both vessels by 0630.  The separation of the two vessels at 0900 resulted in an increased rate of spillage from theOregon Standard.  Concentrated efforts were directed at recovering oil still within the vessel's ruptured tanks.By the evening of January 18, Standard Oil had deployed numerous personnel and equipment along shoreline areas to recover the oil as it was beached.  By January 19, bird cleaning stations were established in several areas under the direction of CA DFG.Standard Oil was efficient in deploying cleanup resources well in advance of the oil movement due to good contingency planning.  The oil spill reached its maximum extent by January 20.  Skimming operations continued until January 27, at which time all beaches in the contaminated area were declared to be at least 95% clean.

The platform included 22 production wells with a capacity of 15,000 barrels of crude oil per day.  The flames from the burning platform blazed 400 feet into the air.  The 21-B well, with a 424-barrel per day capacity, ruptured 12 feet above the water.  By December 3, the service crane had collapsed towards the center of the platform at a 60? angle.  Burning oil covered the surface of the water within 50 feet of the platform.  By December 7, well No. 21-B was contributing to 30-50 percent of the fire.  Shifting winds, fog and rough seas slowed response efforts at times.Holes were shot into the tubing of some of the wells to determine whether oil was still being produced.  On January 12, Shell Oil Co. personnel perforated a relief well in an attempt to contain the flow.  On January 20, eight of the wells remained on fire.  Corexit 7664 dispersant was applied to the slick at a rate of 3 barrels per hour.Response operations began moderating on March 1.  A U.S. Coast Guard cutter and helicopter were released from the scene.  Shell Oil Co. officials were required to submit daily pollution reports to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), New Orleans, in advance of any operations that may have increased pollution.  Drilling, capping, and pumping of the wells continued throughout April.  By April 16, the estimated rate of release was 20 barrels per day.  The slick was reportedly staying within a 6-mile radius of the platform, with sheen extending to 12 miles.  The slick was reduced to sheen during the following months as pumping and capping operations continued.Beach surveys were conducted by personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard, Shell Oil Co., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries, and other local observers.  The only shoreline oiling that resulted from the incident was  between Caminada Pass and Bay Champagne.  The case was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard on May 17, 1971.

The vessel was old and the oceanic crossing was scheduled to be her final journey.  After delivery of her cargo, the ship was destined for destruction as scrap.  Shortly following departure, a welded seam ruptured between two steel plates on the starboard side, well above the water line.  The U.S. harbor authorities refused permission to return to Los Angeles.  The vessel then proceeded to Ensenada Harbor in Baja California to have the ruptured seam repaired by welding.  Authorities in Ensenada refused permission to have the repair work done within the Harbor so welders were taken aboard and the ship proceeded offshore an estimated 60 miles to have the welding accomplished.  At this distance offshore, the vessel may have been situated within the influence of the southward-flowing California Current System. Welding repairs were completed successfully.  Unfortunately, a dense fog settled throughout the region.  A single sun sight was made within the two days offshore, to establish the ship's position.  On this basis, a return to Ensenada was undertaken to offload the welders.  In the early morning hours of March 29 1957, the vessel struck the coast at a location about 64 km south of Ensenada Harbor.  The bow grounded against one side of the entrance to a small cove on a predominantly rocky shore.  The stern apparently swung around and stuck on a shallow spot midway across the cove (henceforth Tampico cove) entrance.  The hull thus served as a breakwater across about 2/3 of the cove entrance, creating fairly calm conditions landward of the hull.  The crew and passengers were able to disembark and reach shore safely in the lee of the hull.  A portion of the oil cargo was liberated at the time of grounding.  The remainder escaped over the next 6-9 months as the ship was slowly torn asunder by pounding surf.   The location was in a remote section of coastline so no countermeasures were taken to remove a portion of the cargo or lessen ensuing pollution of the shore.  A few shacks scattered along the coast here housed native fishermen and their families.  The site was accessible by an extremely rough road, best negotiated by 4-wheel drive vehicles.  The main paved highway ran about 10-20 miles inland and the trip from there  to the study site required 2-3 hours.
